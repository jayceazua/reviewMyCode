I found myself with nobody to ask to review my code, nobody to tell me what to improve.
So I went about creating a platform where these problems no longer exist, a place where collaboration is
expressly encouraged. enjoy as I take you on the epic journey which is development.

initial trepidation of how anything like this would be received by the masses, would I have the motivation to follow
through with my ideas. but I decided to ignore those concerns and, for lack of better terms, just do it.


I help software developers, achieve increased collaboration of both convention and configuration of code,
through a website where open discussion and review of submitted code samples can be had.

Sprint Planning - A meeting to determine what will happen in the next sprint based on what needs to get done and the teams capacity to work.

Sprint Retrospective - A meeting in the time between a sprint and the next sprint planning where the team assess the previous sprint.
  Considering what went well and what didn't and then making a plan for improving what didn't go as well as expected in future sprints
  or ensuring that the well done actions are able to be repeated.

Doing sprint plannings and retrospectives helps teams coordinate efforts to achieve a larger goal and also
improve the methods to achieve a larger goal. As a team Jayce Azua and I, Jeremy James, stated at various points in time that certain things
needed to get done and then we set about doing them.

Problems -
  None!
